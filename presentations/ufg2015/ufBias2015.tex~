Preliminary analysis reveals that:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Malapportionent is substantial

\item Yet no evidence of systematic party bias

\item But \textbf{huge} large-party bonus (PRI is small in few states)

\item Are effects of malapp.\ eclipsed by inter-election volatility?

\item Study residuals from estimation: relation to \\ malapp.? turnout diff.? geography of support?

\item Larger project     \hyperlink{fr:MxMapProj}{\beamergotobutton{Link}}


\end{enumerate}
