How does redistricting affect representation?

\begin{itemize}
\item Taking map drawing out of the hands of politicians \\ does not necessarily ensure a fair result
\end{itemize}

\bigskip

Does malapportionment introduce political bias?

\begin{itemize}
\item Sparsely populated areas get same representation as the densely populated
\end{itemize}

\item Malapportionment is substantial
\item Political distorsions?

Preliminary analysis reveals that:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Malapportionent is substantial

\item Yet no evidence of systematic party bias

\item But \textbf{huge} large-party bonus (PRI is small in few states)

\item And boundary changes affect more PAN than PRD, and especially than PRI

\item Study inter-election volatility? 

\item Study residuals and relation to malapp.? turnout diff.? geography of support?

\end{enumerate}
