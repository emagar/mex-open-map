Studies of U.S.\ and U.K.\  

\begin{itemize}

\item instills bias when one party strong in small districts \\ (as Tories were up to 1997, Johnston 2002)

\item Reapportionment Revolution removed bias in \\ different, predictable degrees (Cox\&Katz 2002)

\item no party bias from malapp.\ after mid-1960s \\ (Grofman et al.~1997)

Redistricting in 1997, 2006, and 2015 (abandoned)

\bigskip

Redistricting process (FPTP):
\begin{enumerate}
\item apportionment of 300 seats to 32 states
\item optimization algorithm $\rightarrow$ proposal
\item parties propose amendments (must improve score)
\item repeat 2 and 3
\item new map
\end{enumerate}

\bigskip

Redistricting by experts, but behind closed doors

\begin{multline*}
\texttt{Score} = .4 \times \texttt{PopBalance} + .3 \times \texttt{MunicBoundaries} \\
+ .2 \times \texttt{TravelTime} + .1 \times \texttt{Compactness}
\end{multline*}

Hamilton method used:

\begin{itemize}
\item The quota (or price of a seat) is $Q = \frac{\text{nation's population}}{300}$

\item First allocation is $\frac{\text{state's population}}{Q}$, rounded down

\item Every state gets 2 seats min. + indigenous voting rights

\item Unallocated seats, if any, awarded to states with largest fractional remainders
\end{itemize}

Most recent decennial census must be used 

\begin{itemize}
\item ... but no obligation to redistrict as soon as available
\item 6-year lag on average: 199\textbf{7}, 200\textbf{6}, 201\textbf{5}    
\item and IFE considers $\pm15\%$ imbalance normal (!)

\item No evidence of systematic party bias

\item Huge large-party bonus (PRI is small in few states)

\item Are effects of malapp.\ eclipsed by inter-election volatility?

\item Study residuals from estimation: relation to \\ malapp.? turnout diff.? geography of support?
